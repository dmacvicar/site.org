* What is a package
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: what-is-a-package
  :END:

A package is a way of distributing software on Linux systems. A single
application is distributed as one or more packages, usually the main
package containing the program, and then some optional or secondary
packages.

On some platforms, applications are self-contained into a directory.
This makes installing an app just adding a folder, and uninstalling the
app, removing it.

Linux systems tend to share as much as components as possible. This is
due partly to some advantages of this philosophy, but it is due mostly
because in the Linux ecosystem, the whole universe is built by the same
entity, except for a few 3rd party applications. This makes easy to
assume that a library is available for all applications to consume. In a
MacOS system, only the core comes from a single vendor, and all
applications come from 3rd parties. It is therefore harder to make
assumptions, and they tend to ship their own version of any depending
component, with the exception of everything documented as the
"platform".

For example, if an application requires the SSL library and the Qt
toolkit. On a Linux system, it will likely use both components from the
Linux distribution, while the MacOS version will likely use the SSL
library from the OS, but ship its own version of Qt, as it is not a
standard MacOS library.

** Anatomy of a package
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: anatomy-of-a-package
   :END:

Lets start with a famous UNIX tool: =rsync=.

So a package is an archive file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64.rpm
#+END_EXAMPLE

containing all files related to the application:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpm -qpl rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64.rpm

  /etc/logrotate.d/rsync
  /etc/rsyncd.conf
  /etc/rsyncd.secrets
  /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2.d/services/rsync-server
  /etc/xinetd.d/rsync
  /usr/bin/rsync
  /usr/bin/rsyncstats
  /usr/lib/systemd/system/rsyncd.service
  /usr/sbin/rcrsyncd
  /usr/sbin/rsyncd
  /usr/share/doc/packages/rsync

  /usr/share/man/man1/rsync.1.gz
  /usr/share/man/man5/rsyncd.conf.5.gz
#+END_EXAMPLE

plus some extra metadata. This metadata includes but it is not limited
to:

- =Name=, =Summary=, =Description=, =License=, etc.

  Summary     : Versatile tool for fast incremental file transfer
  Description :
  Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file  copying  tool. It can copy
  locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync
  daemon. It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its
  behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be
  copied. It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount
  of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the
  source files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used
  for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.
  Distribution: openSUSE Tumbleweed

For example, a package may need a library, or an executable that is
called during runtime.

- What does the package provide for other packages to work (=Provides=)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpm -qp --provides rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64.rpm
  config(rsync) = 3.1.2-1.5
  rsync = 3.1.2-1.5
  rsync(x86-64) = 3.1.2-1.5
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Installing packages
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installing-packages
   :END:

When a package is installed, the content (list of files) is placed on
the system at the location of each file path relative to the root (=/=)
folder.

Additionally, the metadata of the package and the fact that is installed
is recorded in a system-wide database located in =/var/lib/rpm=, managed
by the rpm tool, which is the tool that manages packages at the lowest
level.

Packages can be installed with the =rpm= tools:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpm -U rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64.rpm
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you do this, you can perform the same queries without specifying
the =-p= option and use what is called the NVRA
(name-version-release-architecture, =rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64=) or a
subset of it, e.g. just name (=rsync=).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpm -q --provides rsync
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =rpm= tool will not help you if the dependencies of the package are
not met at installation time. It will just refuse to install the package
to avoid having the system in an inconsistent state.

Features like an automatical finding of the required packages and
retrieving them are implemented in higher-level tools like =zypper=.

** Dependency matching
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dependency-matching
   :END:

You saw above that a package has a list of =Requires= and =Provides=.
Those aren't package names, but arbitrary symbols. A package can require
any string of text and provide anything.

The main rule is that each package provides its own name. So the rsync
package =Provides: rsync=.

You saw that rsync requires =/bin/sh=. While this looks like a file
name, here it is an arbitrary symbol and the meaning is given by the
whole distribution. Why it does not require a package named =sh=
instead? Well, this is for various reasons:

- It provides a layer of indirection that makes the system cohesive.

=/bin/sh= is a capability provided by the =bash= package. This allows
rsync to depend on any shell implementation as long as it provides that
symbol.

The distribution build system will scan all executables a package
installs in a system and inject automatically those =Provides=, so that
the packager does not need to take care of them.

We will see later that the same is done with libraries. Instead of
=rsync= depending on the =glibc= package, when =glibc= was built, the
build system scanned the content, found =/lib64/libc.so.6= and injected
a =Provides: libc.so.6()(64bit)= into the =glibc= metadata. In the case
of shared libraries it is not that important where they are located, as
the linker configuration takes care of that. When the =rsync= package
was built (=glibc= had to be installed at that point to build it), the
build system scanned the executable =/usr/lib/rsync= and realized it was
linked against =libc.so.6=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ldd /usr/bin/rsync
          linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffccb34a000)
          libacl.so.1 => /lib64/libacl.so.1 (0x00007fc406028000)
          libpopt.so.0 => /usr/lib64/libpopt.so.0 (0x00007fc405e1b000)
          libslp.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libslp.so.1 (0x00007fc405c02000)
          libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc405863000)
          libattr.so.1 => /lib64/libattr.so.1 (0x00007fc40565e000)
          libcrypto.so.1.0.0 => /lib64/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007fc4051c4000)
          libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fc404fa7000)
          /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00005653cd048000)
          libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fc404da3000)
          libz.so.1 => /lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00007fc404b8d000)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Therefore, it injected =Requires: libc.so.6()(64bit)= to the =rsync=
package.

Compare it to other packaging systems. Package =musicplayer= requires
=libsound=. =/usr/bin/musicplayer= links to =/usr/lib64/libsound.so.5=.
Later, =musicplayer= is rebuilt against a newer =libsound=, which is not
published. The user installs =musicplayer= with no issues because it
only =Requires: libsound= (as in package name). Then when he/she tries
to run it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ musicplayer
  error while loading shared libraries: libsound.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
#+END_EXAMPLE

The layer of indirection of automatically injected dependencies prevents
this manual work of keeping dependencies in sync. Package provide what
they really carry (because provides are injected by advanced scanners),
and packages require what they really need (because requires are
injected by scanning executables, scripts for shebangs, etc.

This makes rpm based distributions using these conventions highly
cohesive. It makes less problematic to do upgrades without breaking your
system. At the same time, the conventions and indirections between
provides and requires, allow for packages to depend on more abstract
capabilities, instead of specific package names (which sometimes get
renamed, split, obsoleted, etc). Yes, you can be sure the =vim= package
provides =vi=.

There are also other dependencies with more advances purposes:
=Conflicts=, =Obsoletes=, etc. You may already guess what purposes they
have.

** Weak dependencies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: weak-dependencies
   :END:

Not everything is as strict. Sometimes a package works better if another
package is present. Sometimes a package enhances the functionality of
another package, however in neither case they are required. For this
purpose, packages can have:

- =Recommends=: a soft version of requires. If the recommended packages
  are not installed, the package will be installed anyway. Higher level
  tools, however, may pull automatically recommended packages based on
  user settings. The reverse of this dependency is =Supplements=. For
  example a =spellchecker= could =Supplements= an =office-suite=
  package.
- =Suggests= and =Enhances= are the forward and backward version of
  =Recommends= and =Supplements= in a weaker version.

* Working with packages
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: working-with-packages
  :END:

For daily system administration and maintenance, the =rpm= tool is not
sufficient. You will quickly fall into what is called the "dependency
hell". Downloading packages by hand in order to satisfy a dependency to
quickly realize this new package also requires something else.

This problem is solved by a tool that implements a solver. The solver
takes:

- The list of installed packages (and therefore all its dependencies)
- The list of available packages
- The user request ("install package foo", "upgrade system")

The solver performs an operation that is finding the best solution to a
problem that has many solutions. Therefore "best" is defined by
policies, user settings, the distribution itself, etc.

On SUSE systems, the solver is implemented by the
[[https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv][libsolv]] project. This engine
implements both a satisfiability algorithm and an efficient way to
represent the problem in memory. It was developed originally by Michael
Schroeder at SUSE, but nowadays it powers even other distribution
package managers, like Fedora's
[[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF][=dnf=]].

The rest of the package manager includes:

- Handling of package repositories
- Checking the integrity of packages
- Fetching remote packages
- Reading and honoring user/system policies

This functionality in SUSE systems is implemented by the
[[https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Libzypp][ZYpp]] library, which also
includes a command-line tool called =zypper=. While tools like
[[https://yast.github.io/][YaST]] also interact with ZYpp, on the
console you will likely interact with =zypper=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ zypper install rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64.rpm
#+END_EXAMPLE

Will, unlike rpm, figure out what else your system is missing, retrieve
it, and then install all the required packages in the right order. It
will also warn you if another package conflicts with what you are
installing, of if the operation has more than one solution, and ask you
for decisions on what to do.

Now, when we say "retrieve other packages", the question arises. From
where?

** Repositories
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: repositories
   :END:

You can see that =zypper= can install a package directly from an rpm
file. Now, if there is the need for installing dependencies or
retrieving packages i.e. when you upgrade a system, you will need a
"library" of packages. This is what is called a repository. A repository
is:

- A collection of packages
- A set of metadata files

The metadata is nothing more than the information present in the rpm
file (Name, Description, Dependencies). The metadata allows the package
manager to operate with the repository without having all rpm files
locally. Every operation is processed used what we know about the
package, and then rpm files are retrieved on demand at installation
time.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ zypper lr

  # | Alias          | Name           | Enabled | GPG Check | Refresh
  --+----------------+----------------+---------+-----------+--------
  1 | non-oss        | NON-OSS        | Yes     | ( p) Yes  | Yes
  2 | oss            | OSS            | Yes     | ( p) Yes  | Yes
  3 | oss-update     | OSS Update     | Yes     | ( p) Yes  | Yes
  4 | update-non-oss | Update Non-Oss | Yes     | ( p) Yes  | Yes
#+END_EXAMPLE

A system normally will have the following repositories:

- The base repository, which contains all the distribution packages.
- Additional modules, addons products or extensions.
- An update repository for each base product or extension

Running list repositories with =-u= i.e. =zypper lr -u= will show you
the URI of the repository. e.g.
=http://download.opensuse.org/update/leap/42.2/oss/=. If you visit this
URI, you will see:

- a =x86_64= directory containing all architecture-dependent packages
  (i.e. ones that contain executables, shared libraries, etc)
- a =noarch= directory containing architecture-independent packages
  (i.e. ones containing data or scripts)
- a =repodata= directory, containing the metadata for all packages.

The metadata for this type of repositories consists in a
=repodata/repomd.xml= file index, that is signed (=repomd.xml.asc=)
using a key already present in the original system.
=repodata/repomd.xml= refers to other metadata file with their
checksums. The most important is =primary.xml= which contains all
package dependencies.

If you have a directory with rpm packages, you can create the metadata
for them using the =createrepo= tool. After that, you can serve that
repository via HTTP.

If you have a directory with rpms you want to use as a repository, you
don't need to add metadata. =ZYpp= allows to have a plain local
directory as a repository, and will read the metadata directly from the
rpm files into its cache.

*** Refreshing a repository
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: refreshing-a-repository
    :END:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ zypper ref
#+END_EXAMPLE

While the base repository of the distribution is normally immutable,
repositories like the one containing updates get new content often. The
meaning of refreshing a repository is to get the up to date version of
the metadata locally, so that all operations (solving, retrieval) match
the current content of the repository.

If a repository is out of date, it means the local metadata represents a
previous version of the repository content. We would solve, and likely
fetch packages, but those packages may not exists in the repository
anymore, so you will get an error at retrieval time.

The list of repositories of the system is kept in =/etc/zypp/repos.d=.
=zypper= provides most of repository operations in a safer way than
messing with those files by hand.

During refresh, metadata is cached locally at =/var/cache/zypp/raw= and
converted to an efficient format for solving operations in
=/var/cache/zypp/solv=.

*** Services
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: services
    :END:

Services are a higher-level version of repositories. It is another index
that lists repositories. When the system is subscribed to a service,
refreshing the service will result in a new list of repositories, and
the package manager will add new ones or remove obsolete ones.

Services are used for example on SUSE Linux Enterprise with the SUSE
Customer Center. A customer is subscribed to a service provided by SCC
using a credential. The customer, based on his entitlements, can
"activate" a new product. SUSE Customer Center knows about those
activations, and on service refresh, it will provide a new list of
repositories that includes the new activated product.

Services can be remote (like SCC), or local (via a plugin installed on
the system). The package manager asks the plugin for a list of
repositories. It is up to the plugin to build that list. This is
normally used for integration with other systems. The connectivity
between =zypper= and
[[http://spacewalk.redhat.com/][Spacewalk]]/[[https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager][SUSE
Manager]] was originally implemented using a local plugin.

*** Repository sources
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: repository-sources
    :END:

If you are using SUSE Linux Enterprise, your repositories will appear
after the =SUSEConnect= tool registers your product against the
[[https://scc.suse.com][SUSE Customer Center]].

If you are on openSUSE, the default installation will setup the base and
update repositories. Additionally, there is a lot of content published
by the community on the [[https://software.opensuse.org/search][build
service projects]] (but please note that packages from unofficial
repositories are not reviewed by openSUSE) or via projects like
[[http://packman.links2linux.org/][packman]].

SUSE Linux Enterprise users can take advantage of the community content
via the [[https://packagehub.suse.com/][Package Hub]].

** Other package manager operations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: other-package-manager-operations
   :END:

You can use =zypper lu= to list updates. =zypper up= to update them.

You can lock packages to avoid them being removed or pulled-in using
=zypper addlock= =zypper removelock=. You can also list active locks
with =zypper locks=.

The distribution upgrade operation =dup= is used to do destructive
upgrades. This means packages may be suggested for removal as
dependencies like =Obsoletes= are taken into account. It is usually used
for upgrading major releases or to update rolling distributions like
[[https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed][Tumbleweed]]. It has to be
used with care.

** Other solvable types (Products, Patterns, System)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: other-solvable-types-products-patterns-system
   :END:

The package manager solver loads all available and installed packages to
do the solving. However, there are other entities similar to packages
that also have dependencies.

*** Patterns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: patterns
    :END:

Patterns are used to install a collection of software in a comfortable
way. For example you can install a working Laptop-oriented system with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ zypper install -t pattern laptop
#+END_EXAMPLE

But where do patterns come from? They don't exist on their own. The
package managers create them dynamically from packages names
=patterns-XXXXXX= which have a special set of dependencies. So
installing a pattern would actually install the package representing
that pattern. The other way around is true, if you install the package
representing the pattern, it will make the system look like the pattern
is installed.

=$ zypper info --provides patterns-desktop-laptop= would show you some
of the magic behind patterns (equivalent to
=rpm -q --provides patterns-desktop-laptop=).

*** Products
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: products
    :END:

Similar to patterns, products can be queried with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ zypper search -t product
#+END_EXAMPLE

Product comes from a package called XXXXXX-release which has some
special dependencies (=rpm -q --provides openSUSE-release=). The release
package/product installs some information in =/etc/products.d= that is
used by other tools to get information about the base and addons
products installed.

*** Patches
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: patches
    :END:

Patches are used for updates and described by the =updateinfo.xml=
section of the metadata. They represent an entity that conflicts with
older versions of one or more packages. Installing a patch does not
install packages, but generates a conflict in the solver that ends with
the affected version of packages being upgraded.

Patches also carry additional property, like the
[[https://cve.mitre.org/][CVE]] identifiers of the issues they fix or
links to bug tracker incidents.

*** System
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: system
    :END:

During solving, there is one entity providing dependencies that is used
to match locale and hardware information. If you have a WLAN card, the
package manager will dynamically read =/sys/devices= and make this
entity have provides like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Provides :modalias(pci:v0000104Cd0000840[01]sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, a package providing a WLAN driver for some cards (e.g.
=wlan-kmp-default=), could have the following dependencies:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Supplements: modalias(kernel-default:pci:v0000104Cd0000840[01]sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)
  Supplements: modalias(kernel-default:pci:v0000104Cd00009066sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)
  Supplements: modalias(kernel-default:pci:v000010B7d00006000sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which results in that at solving time, if the hardware is present, the
driver will be selected automatically.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

  This is one of the core features of the <a href="https://drivers.suse.com/doc/SolidDriver/Kernel_Module_Packages.html#automatic-installation-via-modaliases">Kernel Module Packages section of the SUSE SolidDriver Program</a>.

Something similar is done with translation packages and the current
configured system locale.

*** Important notes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: important-notes
    :END:

What is important to note is that all those types are only really
present at solving time. In reality, your system is only packages, and
all information comes from the installed packages. Every operation on
patches, patterns and products result in a package operation. This is to
make the package manager compatible with the lower level =rpm= tool.

* Creating packages
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: creating-packages
  :END:

Packages are created providing a so-called =.spec= file. A spec file
defines the attributes of the package, explicit dependencies (others are
injected as we already mentioned), and how the content of the package is
created. A very simple spec file would be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Name:           mypackage
  Version:        1.0
  Release:        0
  License:        MIT
  Summary:        Dummy package
  BuildRoot:      %{_tmppath}/%{name}-%{version}-build

  %description
  Dummy text

  %install
  mkdir -p %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/%{name}
  touch %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/%{name}/CONTENT

#+END_EXAMPLE

This spec file just creates a directory =/usr/share/mypackage= and puts
a dummy =CONTENT= file in it.

spec files are heavily defined by macros that make sure that paths and
values are specified by the distribution. Those macros are shipped by
the base distribution and are located in =/usr/lib/rpm= and =/etc/rpm=.
Other packages may contribute more macros. For example the macros
defined in =/usr/lib/rpm/golang-macros.rb= are provided by the
=golang-packaging= package and are useful to create packages that use
the Go language.

** Common macros
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: common-macros
   :END:

When building spec files, you should be familiar with
[[https://en.opensuse.org/SUSE_Package_Conventions/RPM_Macros][macros]]
like =%{_prefix}=, =%{_datadir}=, =%{_mandir}=, =%{_libdir}=,
=%{_bindir}=, etc. You can evaluate a macro like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpm --eval "%{_libdir}"
  /usr/lib64
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Sub-packages
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sub-packages
   :END:

Sometimes from a single source you will build multiple components that
are independent of each other.

The sources for an =Office Suite= may result in:

- A Word Processor
- A Spreadsheet
- Common libraries
- Development files

For this, you can declare
[[http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-subpack.html][subpackages]], which
is an independent description and attributes section for each component.
The build section is common, and then again in the =%files= section, you
will declare which files go to each subpackage. In this case you would
end with something like:

- =office-wordprocessor=
- =office-spreadsheet=
- =liboffice=
- =office-devel=

** Building with rpmbuild
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: building-with-rpmbuild
   :END:

You can build a package with the =rpmbuild= tool. It requires the spec
file to be in a specific location, so I usually tweak the standard
configuration so that spec files are searched in the current directory:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cat ~/.rpmmacros
  %topdir /space/packages
  %_builddir %{topdir}/build
  %_rpmdir %{topdir}/rpms
  %_sourcedir %(echo $PWD)
  %_specdir %(echo $PWD)
  %_srcrpmdir %{topdir}/rpms
#+END_EXAMPLE

As you can see, I also configure it so that built packages are saved in
=/space/packages=. Tweak that to your own preferences.

Once I have this setup, I can do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpmbuild -bb mypackage.spec
  Executing(%install): /bin/sh -e /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.lVzwnj
  + umask 022
  + cd /space/packages/build
  + mkdir -p /home/duncan/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64/usr/share/mypackage
  + touch /home/duncan/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64/usr/share/mypackage/CONTENT
  + /usr/lib/rpm/brp-compress
  + /usr/lib/rpm/brp-suse
  Processing files: mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64
  Provides: mypackage = 1.0-0 mypackage(x86-64) = 1.0-0
  Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1
  Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files /home/duncan/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64
  Wrote: /space/packages/rpms/x86_64/mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64.rpm
  Executing(%clean): /bin/sh -e /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.0xLGri
  + umask 022
  + cd /space/packages/build
  + /usr/bin/rm -rf /home/duncan/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64
  + rm -rf filelists
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now I can verify the content of the package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  % rpm -qpl /space/packages/rpms/x86_64/mypackage-1.0-0.x86_64.rpm
  /usr/share/mypackage/CONTENT
#+END_EXAMPLE

As you can see, everything that we put into the =%{buildroot}= ended as
content of the package.

Now the term "building a package" can have two meanings. One is
assembling the package from existing content. You could build your
application in Jenkins, take the built artifacts and use the spec file
to package it.

However, where rpm really shines is that you can build the application
in the spec file itself, and use the distribution and dependencies to
setup the build environment.

A common use case to illustrate this is the typical Linux application
built with =configure && make && make install=. Lets try to build a
package for [[http://gqlplus.sourceforge.net][gqlplus]], an alternative
client for Oracle databases.

Provided that you have readline and ncurses development headers, you can
build this application just unpacking the tarball and performing the
commands mentioned above. Some programs require an extra step with
=autoconf= in order to generate the =configure= script. This is specific
to building software and has nothing to do with packaging. Certainly
building a Qt based program will be a different experience, and if you
build a Java application, you will have to deal with other tools.

When you do =./configure= you would need to pass the right =--prefix=.
This is where macros help you. You could do
=configure --prefix=%{_prefix}=, however, there is a better macro called
=%configure= which takes care and sets most of the configure options
(try expanding it: =echo $(rpm --eval '%configure')=)

Now, the package can't build if some libraries are not present, a C
compiler is there, and the basic build tools (make) are not available.
That is what =BuildRequires= are for. They define what packages are
needed for building, but not necessarily at runtime.

On the other hand, the original =oracle-instantclient-sqlplus= package
is required at runtime, but we don't need it to build our package.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  %description
  GQLPlus is a drop-in replacement for sqlplus, an Oracle SQL client, for UNIX and UNIX-like platforms. The difference between GQLPlus and sqlplus is command-line editing and history, plus table-name and column-name completion.

  %prep
  %setup -q

  %build

  automake --add-missing
  %configure

  %doc ChangeLog README LICENSE
  %{_bindir}/gqlplus

  %changelog
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =Source0= section specifies a source that you can refer later using
the =%SOURCE0= or =%{S:0}= macros. You can have more than one source
(=Source1=, etc).

The prep section uses the
[[http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-inside-macros.html#S2-RPM-INSIDE-SETUP-MACRO][%setup]]
macro to unpack the sources. You could as well operate directly on the
source files if you need to do something unconventional.

As we need =make install= to install the files inside =%{buildroot}=, we
should call =make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}=, but =%makeinstall= is
just a macro for that.

The files section list the files =rpmbuild= should expect to find inside
=%{buildroot}= that will be the content of the package.

Note also that we don't need to add a runtime =Requires= to the readline
and ncurses libraries. Because the executable is linked against the ones
installed by the -devel packages, it will be scanned and the right
=Requires= injected:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rpm -qp --requires gqlplus-1.15-0.x86_64.rpm
  libc.so.6()(64bit)
  ...
  libncurses.so.6()(64bit)
  libreadline.so.7()(64bit)
  oracle-instantclient-sqlplus
  ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

These symbols are provided by the right package, so the solver will
match them:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  rpm -q --whatprovides 'libncurses.so.6()(64bit)'
  libncurses6-6.0-19.1.x86_64
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Building in a real build environment
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: building-in-a-real-build-environment
   :END:

Building this way means the build environment is our system. If a
package is in =BuildRequires=, you will have to install it in your
system first.

If the software you are building links against some library only if it
is available, even if you don't mention it in your =BuildRequires=, if
that library is present in your system, it will taint the build and make
=configure= find it.

What if you want to build against /only/ the packages that are in the
build requirements?

*** The Open Build Service
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: the-open-build-service
    :END:

The [[http://openbuildservice.org/][Open Build Service]] allows to build
packages for multiple distributions and architectures. Visit the
[[https://openbuildservice.org/help/][Help Material]] section of the
website for a deeper introduction. For the package we are building, you
can get an account at the [[https://build.opensuse.org][openSUSE Build
Service]] instance. Go to your "Home Project", "Create New Package" and
upload the spec and sources. See the
[[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Tutorial#Workflow][new
package workflow]] for more information.

You need then to configure some target distributions for your home
project. That can be one base distribution or another project. This
shows the power by allowing building based on layers that can override
things from previous layers.

Add the most popular SUSE distributions (latest Leap and Tumbleweed) and
your package will be built automatically. A repository will be published
automatically and made available for public consumption.

Every time the sources changes, the package will be rebuilt, and if you
have more packages in the same project, they will be rebuilt in the
right order and re-published.

[[file:images/gqlplus-obs.png]]

Open Build Service can not only build packages, but also images from
those packages. All SUSE products and the openSUSE distributions are
built using the Open Build Service. Contributors basically submit new
sources, and the Open Build Service takes care of assembling it all
([[https://openqa.opensuse.org/][openQA]] takes later care that it
works).

*** Using the Build Service locally
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: using-the-build-service-locally
    :END:

With the =osc= tool you can checkout packages from OBS, make changes and
resubmit them.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ osc co home:dmacvicar gqlplus
  A    home:dmacvicar
  A    home:dmacvicar/gqlplus
  A    home:dmacvicar/gqlplus/gqlplus-1.15.tar.bz2
  A    home:dmacvicar/gqlplus/gqlplus.changes
  A    home:dmacvicar/gqlplus/gqlplus.spec
  At revision 4.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The most interesting feature is the ability to build locally. "We
already did that!" you may think (=rpmbuild=). However, =osc= allows you
to build in an isolated environment (either a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot][chroot jail]] or a virtual
machine), setting up that environment automatically using the
=BuildRequires= of the spec file, and also allowing you to build against
a different distribution than the one you are running.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cd home:dmacvicar/gqlplus
  $ osc build openSUSE_Leap_42.2
  ...

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Improving the package
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: improving-the-package
   :END:

When you build a package in the build service, you will find out that in
addition to the automated magic that injects dependencies, there is a
bunch of checks being done to the package.

Yes, those checks are quite pedantic. It is the only way to ensure
quality and consistency when a product is assembled from thousands of
sources by hundreds of contributors.

The =spec-cleaner= tool can help you keeping your spec file in shape:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ spec-cleaner -i gqlplus.spec
#+END_EXAMPLE

For example, it can help you converting =BuildRequires: foo-devel=
dependencies to =BuildRequires: pkgconfig(foo)=. If a -devel package
installs a pkg-config module, a =Provides: pkgconfig(foo)= is
automatically injected. If the build process (=./configure= or
=Makefile=) uses pkg-config to find the software, it makes more sense
and it is closer to reality to depend on =pkgconfig(foo)= being present,
regardless of which =-devel= package provides it.

For post-build checks, you can get more information about how to fix
them in the
[[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_checks][openSUSE Packaging
Checks]] page.

** Changelogs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: changelogs
   :END:

Until now we have left the =%changelog= section empty. Some
distributions write there the history for the package. SUSE-flavored
distributions keep the
[[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Creating_a_changes_file_(RPM)][changelog]]
in a separate =.changes= file. To quickly generate or update it, you can
use =osc vc= in the directory containing the spec file and the sources.

The editor used by =osc vc= is determined by the =EDITOR= environment
variable just like for most =git= commands.

** Finding the devel package on OBS
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: finding-the-devel-package-on-obs
   :END:

When contributing to an already-existing package on OBS, it is usually
best to submit any change requests to the project where that package is
developed. It is easy to find the devel project using the =develproject=
(=dp=) command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ osc dp openSUSE:Factory rsync
  network
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create a branch and a local checkout of the package using the =branch=
command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ osc bco network rsync
  A    home:dmacvicar:branches:network
  A    home:dmacvicar:branches:network/rsync
  ...
  At revision 11d4f594469a6679d30ae05f8b2187fd.
  Note: You can use "osc delete" or "osc submitpac" when done.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now, you can make local changes to the package, for example adding a
patch to be applied to the sources after unpacking the source tarball.
You can then build the package locally as described earlier using
=osc build=.

Once you are happy with the package, you can commit it to your personal
project on OBS using =osc commit=. The build service will then build the
package remotely, so this step may reveal more issues (for example if
building on the ARM platform as well) that need to be fixed before
submitting the change to the devel project.

Once everything builds successfully on the build service as well as
locally, you can create a /submit request/ to get the new version merged
into the devel project. To do this, use the =submitrequest= (=sr=)
command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ osc sr
#+END_EXAMPLE

When the package is a branch from an existing project created using the
=branch= command, the build service remembers where the package was
branched from and automatically creates the submit request to that
location. If you want to override this, simply pass the project name as
an argument to =sr=: =osc sr openSUSE:Factory=. This should rarely be
needed, however.
