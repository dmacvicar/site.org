<div class="outline-text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have seen software succeed and fail on all processes and
methodologies.</li>

<li>Most methodologies will work if the people doing the work is
empowered and they have ownership to take decisions.</li>

<li>Any agile frankenstein is better than no structured workflow. Have
the team set and document their preferred workflow and then iterate on it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="on-bugs-and-features">On Bugs and features</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bug backlogs are a bad idea. If you have a large one, toss it away.
(they may be justified if you provide L3 service to a customer)</li>

<li>Feature backlogs are also a bad idea. Focus on the main epics/topics
for the next quarter, and keep a tickets for the X next sprints.</li>

<li>Focus on creating quality earlier in the process, including
pair/mob programming, collaboration, reviews, linters, tests, automation</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-on-technologies" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="on-technologies">On technologies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prefer boring, open-source technology that has been around for a
while, which active base and prospect of maintainership.</li>

<li>Be conservative with dependencies. If you have to, follow the same
criteria as with technologies.</li>

<li>Prefer simple and boring architectures. Simple is harder than
complicated, and more reliable.</li>

<li>SPA&rsquo;s are a bad idea as architecture, and something in the
Javascript ecosystem culture is not right (moving on to new things over maintaining and fixing).</li>

<div class="outline-text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Promote those who act to make things better. Complaining and
pointing out things that suck is too easy.</li>
<li>Ideas and idea people are overrated. Execution makes most of the difference.</li>
<li>Learn to write proposals, policies, pitches.</li>
<li>Learn to have conversations about difficult topics.</li>
<li>Be humble and threat people with respect.</li>
<li>Inexperienced people tend to be more confident and prefer complexity.</li>

<h3 id="on-communication">On communication</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you will work remotely and asynchronous, you and your
organization will need to learn to write well.</li>
<li>Writing one-pagers, pitches, and RFCs is a good way to clear your
own ideas.</li>
<li>Ask for stakeholders to write things down. Only then people realize
how confused they are and the amount of open ends to what seems
simple at first sight.</li>

<div id="outline-container-on-technical-debt-and-legacy-systems" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="on-technical-debt-and-legacy-systems">On technical debt and legacy systems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The term &ldquo;technical debt&rdquo; is overused in meaning, exagerated
and little acted upon.</li>

<li>Part of the reason is unlike writters who had to read hundred books,
developers read little code before they start writing a lot of it.
Reading feels overwhelming.</li>

<li>It look harder to change other&rsquo;s people code than writing new.</li>

<li>Technical debt happens because software lives executing in the head of
developers, not computers. Once nobody is around it is hard to
reason and change it anymore.</li>

<li>Many decisions and assumptions look wrong after some time.</li>

<li>Learn to take advantage of some responsible debt for speed. Like in
real life, 0% debt may not be an optimum.</li>

<li>Empower people to collect, identify, analyse and plan for fixing
technical debt. One step at a time.</li>

<li>Avoid rewrites unless somebody has the full system in their head,
you have enough to test against, or you can suffocate the old system
while keeping things working.</li>
