<h1>LISTEN I HAVE MY RIGHTS!!!!</h1>

Participating in a opensource community has lot of advantages, you get to know really cool people. You learn lot of new things&#x2026; but also strange anecdotes happen.
</p>

<p>
Some time ago I was talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/wstephenson">Will</a>, and we both remembered one of the most funniest (now) things ever happened in <code>#kopete</code> irc channel. We laughed a lot, until Will told me. &ldquo;I still have those logs somewhere&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;Really! I think it is time to blog them.
</p>

<p>
April 3, probably 2003 or 2004. I was in Chile by then. It was sleeping time for Europa. In the channel you can see Sean Egan, GAIM&rsquo;s lead developer, and myself. Until&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The following takes place between 5 am and 6 am&#x2026; Events ocur in real time.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org03fc9aa">
--&gt; Lazlo ([HOST REMOVED].edu) has joined #kopete
&lt;Lazlo&gt; uhh, hi all heh. I have a strange request. is that Sean Egan
from New York (sorry kinda new to irc)
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; hm?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; hello ?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; oh heh
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Um, yeah. I'm from New York
&lt;Lazlo&gt; uh, hi -- I searched on google and it said a 'Sean Egan' was in
this chat room. Do you know where Valley STream is?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Yeah, that's where I live on Long Island
&lt;Lazlo&gt; ehh, what's the zip code heh (sorry for these odd questions I have
to protect an identity here, kinda iffy)?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; hehe, um, it's [ZIP CODE REMOVED]. Who are you?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; uh, Are you at [ADDRESS REMOVED]?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; ok. Who are you?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; can anyone here tell me if this is really Sean Egan?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; they're probably all asleep. This is a very European channel.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; being KDE and all ;)
&lt;Lazlo&gt; uhh, hi all heh. I have a strange request. is that Sean Egan
from New York (sorry
&lt;Lazlo&gt; um, what's KDE? I don't use computers mujch
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; It's alright. Why do you know m address?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; whatever man -- look, are you really Sean Egan?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Yeah.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; um, I think I may have found your wallet near a truck stop
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; really?!
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; haha!
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; I lost my wallet yesterda
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; y
&lt;Lazlo&gt; phew! hah, man i wasn't sure if I could find you heh
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; well, you do have my address ;)
&lt;Lazlo&gt; heh, true but i'm in west virginia. you're credit card is [CREDIT
CARD REMOVED], right?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; ,,,
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Um, I'll take your word for it...
&lt;Lazlo&gt; ?? heh, maybe I should buy some stuff haha
* SeanEgan hopes you're joking.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Ok. The address you have is my Long Island address, but I'm up
at school in Binghamton
&lt;Lazlo&gt; um, i can rent a car with the credit card and drive to drop it off
if you like?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; by the way, who's the hot girl in the picture ;-) heh
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Dude, that's my sister.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Listen, just mail the wallet to me. I'll PM you my address.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; man just calm down -- i'm trying to help here i didn't know
&lt;Lazlo&gt; what about the cost to send it?!?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; no, it's alright. I'm going to PM you my address, and you can
mail it to me?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Um... I don't know. Maybe $2?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; $2?!? i think more than that man
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; If you want, I should have some cash in there, you can pay with
my money.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; But I need my id and my credit cards and stuff.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; look i took the time to search your name and stuff
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; yeah, pay for postage with my own money, I don't care
&lt;Lazlo&gt; i'm not even talking about postage man -- I'll use the card to buy
stuff I think is right, seriously. you owe me big time
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; you want a reward?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; How much cash do I have in there? $30?
&lt;duncanmv&gt; oh, Americans
&lt;Lazlo&gt; whatever dude -- you don't get it! How much do you have on your
card, can i buy some stuff?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; No, you can't
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Are you serious?
* duncanmv doesn't find it a funny joke
&lt;Lazlo&gt; why wouldl i joke?! look, i'll just buy some stuff or you won't
get your wallet
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Lazlo: I just called my bank and they've cancelled the credit
card.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; I'll let you keep all the cash I have in there as a reward, but
if you would please return it to the address I PMed you, I would really
appreciate it.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; ??!?!?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; And so would the Occidental University Police, if you catch my
drift.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; now you WONT GET YOUR FRIGGIN WALLET
&lt;Lazlo&gt; uHGHGHG
&lt;duncanmv&gt; ok, just call his college tomorrow
&lt;duncanmv&gt; and tell them [NAME REMOVED] has your wallet
&lt;duncanmv&gt; tell them the ip and time log
&lt;duncanmv&gt; and tell them you offered him even a reward
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Lazlo: Let's not make a big deal out of it. Keep the cash, and
mail the wallet to that address, ok?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; what the f*XCKC wahta kinda platce is this??!? stay out of
this duncanmv. dude don't you DARE TELL MY schools
&lt;Lazlo&gt; SeanEgan: NO! crap there's only $24 dollars in the WALLET man
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Listen, that wallet has my drivers license in it, it has my
social security card, it has my school id... I really need that.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; You can keep the $24, just mail it back to me, please.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; What do you think is a fair reward?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; F*CUI@ NO!!! look, i could have sold your stuff already but i
didn't. social security cards are expensive
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Listen, how much do you want from me?
&lt;duncanmv&gt; I could have sold your social security card? wtf? gansters?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; LISTEN! I'm talking a few hundred dude -- and some stuff.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; all i know is the people on the internet always look for this
identify stuff
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; It's not worth a few hundred to me. I can just get the ID
reissued for a hundred.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; at most
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; OK, and you just told me that you're selling my social security
number, so I can get new one and make sure it's worthless.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; I'll offer you $100.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; final offer.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; F@#@! FINE dude, whatever -- how will you send me the money then?
i definitely WONT send it until the money gets here. i'm no fool buddy
&lt;duncanmv&gt; ok
&lt;duncanmv&gt; I logged into [UNIVERSITY NAME REMOVED], and got all his data
&lt;duncanmv&gt; ;)
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; My ATM pin is [PIN REMOVED]. That's the Citibank one. If you
withdraw anymore than $100, I report you to the police and they'll have your
picture and everything and you'll go to jail, do you understand me?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Also, I'm changing the PIN FIRST THING tomorrow, so you have to
act on that quick.
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; deal?
&lt;Lazlo&gt; This is some world of shit dudes! i try to help and all you do is
threaten police call!!@@ LISTEN I HAVE MY RIGHTS
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Lazlo: You have no clue how deep trouble you're in right now.
&lt;duncanmv&gt; your rights is stealing Sean's money? come on
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; 10 people have this conversation logged; we have all your
personal data; you really are in no position to talk about your rights.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; WHATEVER This is the LAST time i try to help some looser out who
can't keep his wallet. Where's your gratitude man?
&lt;SeanEgan&gt; Ok. Take $100. Send me my wallet.
&lt;Lazlo&gt; f&amp;%@ fine. you're lucky.
&lt;-- Lazlo has quit ("leaving")
</pre>

<p>
I never knew what happened with Sean&rsquo;s wallet. So today I emailed him and asked. This is the happy end of the story:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ha! I didn&rsquo;t think anyone remembered that! That guy was nuts. I was able to reason with him, though. It turned out I was able to promise him a feature request in Gaim and that sufficed for him. He sent the wallet back, and I never found any weird fraudulent charges on any of my cards ;)
</p>

<p>
My guess is that he wasn&rsquo;t any older than 16.
</p>

<p>
Just remember, every time a Gaim user sends someone a file by dragging it into a conversation window, it&rsquo;s because I lost my wallet.
</p>

<p>
-s.
