* Introduction

This is the source for my website. It is managed using Emacs and [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]].

The latest incarnation is based on [[https://emacs.love/weblorg/][weblorg]], a wrapper on top of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][org-export]].

It used to be a heavily customized org-publish setup, but weblorg puts all together in a simpler setup and add support for Jinja like templates.

For details about the original implementation see [[file:posts/2019-09-03-migrating-from-jekyll-to-org/index.org][the introductory post]] and the [[https://github.com/dmacvicar/site.org/blob/75e54006a7384cfe8504ab8c6b215ab081d3d8ec/publish.el][\faGithub original source]].
