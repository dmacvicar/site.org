#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning
projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text
system.

Created by Carsten Dominik in 2003, maintained by Bastien Guerry and
developed by many others.

To me, the most important aspects are:
- A nice syntax that's more powerful than Markdown, but easier than
  LaTeX.
- the excellent export framework, =ox.el=.
- The code evaluation, Babel or =ob.el=.

It is distributed as part of [[https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
